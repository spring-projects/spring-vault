= Vault support

The Vault support contains a wide range of features which are summarized below.

* Spring configuration support using Java based @Configuration classes
* `VaultTemplate` helper class that increases productivity performing common 
Vault operations.  Includes integrated object mapping between Vault responses and POJOs.

For most tasks, you will find yourself using `VaultTemplate` that leverages the
rich communication functionality. `VaultTemplate` is the place to look for 
accessing functionality such as reading data from Vault or issuing 
administrative commands. `VaultTemplate` also provides callback methods so that it is easy for you to 
get a hold of the low-level API artifacts such as `RestTemplate` to communicate
directly with Vault.
