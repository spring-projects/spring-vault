[[vault.core.template]]
= Introduction to VaultTemplate

The class javadoc:org.springframework.vault.core.VaultTemplate[], located in the package `org.springframework.vault.core`,
is the central class of the Spring's Vault support providing a rich feature set to
interact with Vault. The template offers convenience operations to read, write and
delete data in Vault and provides a mapping between your domain objects and Vault data.

NOTE: Once configured, javadoc:org.springframework.vault.core.VaultTemplate[] is thread-safe and can be reused across
multiple instances.

The mapping between Vault documents and domain classes is done by delegating to
`RestTemplate`. Spring Web support provides the mapping infrastructure.

The javadoc:org.springframework.vault.core.VaultTemplate[] class implements the interface
javadoc:org.springframework.vault.core.VaultOperations[].
In as much as possible, the methods on javadoc:org.springframework.vault.core.VaultOperations[] are named after methods
available on the Vault API to make the API familiar to existing Vault developers
who are used to the API and CLI. For example, you will find methods such as
"write", "delete", "read", and "revoke".
The design goal was to make it as easy as possible to transition between
the use of the Vault API and `VaultOperations`. A major difference in between
the two APIs is that `VaultOperations` can be passed domain objects instead of
JSON Key-Value pairs.

Paths used in `VaultTemplate` (and interfaces accessible from there) are considered
relative to the `VaultEndpoint`. Paths that are fully-qualified URI's can be used
to access Vault cluster members in an authenticated context. To prevent unwanted
full URI access, make sure to sanitize paths before passing them to `VaultTemplate`.

NOTE: The preferred way to reference the operations on javadoc:org.springframework.vault.core.VaultTemplate[] instance
is via its interface javadoc:org.springframework.vault.core.VaultOperations[].

While there are many convenience methods on `VaultTemplate` to help you easily
perform common tasks if you should need to access the Vault API directly to access
functionality not explicitly exposed by the `VaultTemplate` you can use one of
several execute callback methods to access underlying APIs. The execute callbacks
will give you a reference to a `RestOperations` object.
Please see the section <<vault.core.executioncallback,Execution Callbacks>> for more information.

Now let's look at a examples of how to work with Vault in the context of the Spring container.

[[vault.core.template.beans]]
== Registering and configuring Spring Vault beans

Using Spring Vault does not require a Spring Context. However, instances of `VaultTemplate` and
javadoc:org.springframework.vault.authentication.SessionManager[] registered inside a managed context will participate
in {spring-framework-docs}core.html#beans-factory-nature[lifecycle events]
provided by the Spring IoC container. This is useful to dispose active Vault sessions upon
application shutdown. You also benefit from reusing the same `VaultTemplate`
instance across your application.

Spring Vault comes with a supporting configuration class that provides bean definitions
for use inside a Spring context. Application configuration
classes typically extend from javadoc:org.springframework.vault.config.AbstractVaultConfiguration[] and are required to
provide additional details that are environment specific.

Extending from javadoc:org.springframework.vault.config.AbstractVaultConfiguration[] requires to implement
`VaultEndpoint vaultEndpoint()` and `ClientAuthentication clientAuthentication()`
methods.

.Registering Spring Vault objects using Java based bean metadata
====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class AppConfig extends AbstractVaultConfiguration {

    /**
     * Specify an endpoint for connecting to Vault.
     */
    @Override
    public VaultEndpoint vaultEndpoint() {
        return new VaultEndpoint();                            <1>
    }

    /**
     * Configure a client authentication.
     * Please consider a more secure authentication method
     * for production use.
     */
    @Override
    public ClientAuthentication clientAuthentication() {
        return new TokenAuthentication("â€¦");                   <2>
    }
}
----
<1> Create a new javadoc:org.springframework.vault.client.VaultEndpoint[] that points by default to `\https://localhost:8200`.
<2> This sample uses javadoc:org.springframework.vault.authentication.TokenAuthentication[] to get started quickly.
See <<vault.core.authentication>> for details on supported authentication methods.
====

.Registering Spring Vault applying injected properties
====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class AppConfig extends AbstractVaultConfiguration {

    @Value("${vault.uri}")
    URI vaultUri;

    /**
     * Specify an endpoint that was injected as URI.
     */
    @Override
    public VaultEndpoint vaultEndpoint() {
        return VaultEndpoint.from(vaultUri);                          <1>
    }

    /**
     * Configure a Client Certificate authentication.
     * {@link RestOperations} can be obtained from {@link #restOperations()}.
     */
    @Override
    public ClientAuthentication clientAuthentication() {
        return new ClientCertificateAuthentication(restOperations()); <2>
    }
}
----
<1> javadoc:org.springframework.vault.client.VaultEndpoint[] can be constructed using various factory methods such as
`from(URI uri)` or `VaultEndpoint.create(String host, int port)`.
<2> Dependencies for `ClientAuthentication` methods can be obtained either from
`AbstractVaultConfiguration` or provided by your configuration.
====

NOTE: Creating a custom configuration class might be cumbersome in some cases.
Take a look at javadoc:org.springframework.vault.config.EnvironmentVaultConfiguration[] that allows configuration by using
properties from existing property sources and Spring's `Environment`. Read more
in <<vault.core.environment-vault-configuration>>.

[[vault.core.template.sessionmanagement]]
== Session Management

Spring Vault requires a `ClientAuthentication` to login and access Vault.
See <<vault.core.authentication>> on details regarding authentication.
Vault login should not occur on each authenticated Vault interaction but
must be reused throughout a session. This aspect is handled by a
`SessionManager` implementation. A `SessionManager` decides how often it
obtains a token, about revocation and renewal. Spring Vault comes with two implementations:

* javadoc:org.springframework.vault.authentication.SimpleSessionManager[]: Just obtains tokens from the supplied
`ClientAuthentication` without refresh and revocation
* javadoc:org.springframework.vault.authentication.LifecycleAwareSessionManager[]: This `SessionManager` schedules token
renewal if a token is renewable and revoke a login token on disposal.
Renewal is scheduled with an `AsyncTaskExecutor`. `LifecycleAwareSessionManager`
is configured by default if using `AbstractVaultConfiguration`.

[[vault.core.environment-vault-configuration]]
== Using `EnvironmentVaultConfiguration`

Spring Vault includes javadoc:org.springframework.vault.config.EnvironmentVaultConfiguration[] configure the Vault client from Spring's `Environment` and a set of predefined
property keys.
javadoc:org.springframework.vault.config.EnvironmentVaultConfiguration[] supports frequently applied configurations. Other configurations are supported by deriving from the most appropriate configuration class.
Include javadoc:org.springframework.vault.config.EnvironmentVaultConfiguration[] with `@Import(EnvironmentVaultConfiguration.class)` to existing
Java-based configuration classes and supply configuration properties through any of Spring's ``PropertySource``s.

[[vault.core.executioncallback]]
== Execution callbacks

One common design feature of all Spring template classes is that all functionality is routed into one of the templates execute callback methods.
This helps ensure that exceptions and any resource management that maybe required are performed consistency.
While this was of much greater need in the case of JDBC and JMS than with Vault, it still offers a single spot for access and logging to occur.
As such, using the execute callback is the preferred way to access the Vault API
to perform uncommon operations that we've not exposed as methods on javadoc:org.springframework.vault.core.VaultTemplate[].

Here is a list of execute callback methods.

* `<T> T` *doWithVault* `(RestOperationsCallback<T> callback)` Executes the given
`RestOperationsCallback`, allows to interact with Vault using  `RestOperations` without requiring a session.

* `<T> T` *doWithSession* `(RestOperationsCallback<T> callback)` Executes the given
`RestOperationsCallback`, allows to interact with Vault in an authenticated session.

Here is an example that uses the `ClientCallback` to initialize Vault:

====
[source,java]
----
vaultOperations.doWithVault(new RestOperationsCallback<VaultInitializationResponse>() {

  @Override
  public VaultInitializationResponse doWithRestOperations(RestOperations restOperations) {

    ResponseEntity<VaultInitializationResponse> exchange = restOperations
                       .exchange("/sys/init", HttpMethod.PUT,
                                 new HttpEntity<Object>(request),
                                 VaultInitializationResponse.class);

    return exchange.getBody();
    }
});
